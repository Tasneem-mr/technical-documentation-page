      <header>A dependency in your project</header>
      <p>A dependency is a third-party bit of software that was probably written by someone else and ideally solves a
        single problem for you. A web project can have any number of dependencies, ranging from none to many, and your
        dependencies might include sub-dependencies that you didn't explicitly install — your dependencies may have
        their own dependencies.</p>
      <p>A simple example of a useful dependency that your project might need is some code to calculate relative dates
        as human-readable text. You could certainly code this yourself, but there's a strong chance that someone else
        has already solved this problem — why waste time reinventing the wheel? Moreover, a reliable third-party
        dependency will likely have been tested in a lot of different situations, making it more robust and
        cross-browser compatible than your own solution.</p>
      <p>A project dependency can be an entire JavaScript library or framework — such as React or Vue — or a very small
        utility like our human-readable date library, or it can be a command line tool such as Prettier or ESLint, which
        we talked about in previous articles.</p>
      <p>Without modern build tools, dependencies like this might be included in your project using a simple
        <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> element, but this might not work right out of the box and you will likely need some
        modern tooling to bundle your code and dependencies together when they are released on the web. A bundle is the
        term that's generally used to refer to a single file on your web server that contains all the JavaScript for
        your software — typically compressed as much as possible to help reduce the time it takes to get your software
        downloaded and displayed in your visitors' browser.</p>
      <p>In addition, what happens if you find a better tool that you want to use instead of the current one, or a new
        version of your dependency is released that you want to update to? This is not too painful for a couple of
        dependencies, but in larger projects with many dependencies this kind of thing can become really challenging to
        keep track of. It makes more sense to use a package manager such as npm, as this will guarantee that the code is
        added and removed cleanly, as well as a host of other advantages.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="What_exactly_is_a_package_manager?">
      <header>What exactly is a package manager?</header>
      <p>We've met npm already, but stepping back from npm itself, a package manager is a system that will manage your
        project dependencies.</p>
      <p>The package manager will provide a method to install new dependencies (also referred to as "packages"), manage
        where packages are stored on your file system, and offer capabilities for you to publish your own packages.</p>
      <p>In theory you may not need a package manager and you could manually download and store your project
        dependencies, but a package manager will seamlessly handle installing and uninstalling packages. If you didn't
        use one, you'd have to manually handle:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Finding all the correct package JavaScript files.</li>
        <li>Checking them to make sure they don't have any known vulnerabilities.</li>
        <li>Downloading them and putting them in the correct locations in your project.</li>
        <li>Writing the code to include the package(s) in your application (this tends to be done using JavaScript
          modules, another subject that is worth reading up on and understanding).</li>
        <li>Doing the same thing for all of the packages' sub-dependencies, of which there could be tens, or hundreds.
        </li>
        <li>Removing all the files again if you want to remove the packages.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In addition, package managers handle duplicate dependencies (something that becomes important and common in
        front-end development).</p>
      <p>In the case of npm (and JavaScript- and Node-based package managers) you have two options for where you install
        your dependencies. As we touched on in the previous article, dependencies can be installed globally or locally
        to your project. Although there tend to be more pros for installing globally, the pros for installing locally
        are more important — such as code portability and version locking.</p>
      <p>For example, if your project relied on Webpack with a certain configuration, you'd want to ensure that if you
        installed that project on another machine or returned to it much later on, the configuration would still work.
        If a different version of Webpack was installed, it may not be compatible. To mitigate this, dependencies are
        installed locally to a project.</p>
      <p>To see local dependencies really shine, all you need to do is try to download and run an existing project — if
        it works and all the dependencies work right out of the box, then you have local dependencies to thank for the
        fact that the code is portable.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Package_registries">
      <header>Package registries</header>
      <p>For a package manager to work, it needs to know where to install packages from, and this comes in the form of a
        package registry. The registry is a central place that a package is published to and thus can be installed from.
        npm, as well as being a package manager, is also the name of the most commonly-used package registry for
        JavaScript packages. The npm registry exists at npmjs.com.</p>
      <p>npm is not the only option. You could manage your own package registry — products like Microsoft Azure allow
        you to create proxies to the npm registry (so you can override or lock certain packages), GitHub also offers a
        package registry service, and there will be likely more options appearing as time goes on.</p>
      <p>What is important is that you ensure you've chosen the best registry for you. Many projects will use npm, and
        we'll stick to this in our examples throughout the rest of the module.</p>

    <section class="main-section" id="Using_the_package_ecosystem">
      <header>Using the package ecosystem</header>
      <p>Using the package ecosystem
        Let's run through an example to get you started with using a package manager and registry to install a command
        line utility.</p>
      <p>Parcel is another tool that developers commonly use in their development process. Parcel is clever in that it
        can watch the contents of our code for calls to dependencies and automatically installs any dependencies it sees
        that our code needs. It can also automatically build our code.</p>
      <p>In our previous chapter we installed Prettier as a global tool. Here however, let's use npm to install Parcel
        as a local tool, as best practices dictate. We'll install it as part of an experimental app.</p>
      <h1>Setting up the app as an npm package</h1>
      <p>First of all, create a new directory to store our experimental app in, somewhere sensible that you'll find
        again. We'll call it parcel-experiment, but you can call it whatever you like:</p>
      <pre class="brush: bash notranslate"><code><span class="token function">mkdir</span> parcel-experiment
<span class="token builtin class-name">cd</span> parcel-experiment
</code></pre>
      <p>Next, let's initialise our app as an npm package, which creates a config file — package.json — that allows us
        to save our configuration details in case we want to recreate this environment later on, or even publish the
        package to the npm registry (although this is somewhat beyond the scope of this article).</p>
      <p>Type the following command, making sure you are inside the parcel-experiment directory:</p>
      <pre class="brush: bash notranslate"><code><span class="token function">npm</span> init
</code></pre>
      <p>You will now be asked some questions; npm will then create a default package.json file based on the answers:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <code>name</code>: A name to identify the app. Just press
          <code>Return</code>
          to accept the default <code>parcel-experiment</code>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>version</code>: The starting version number for the app. Again, just press
          <code>Return</code>
          to accept the default <code>1.0.0</code>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>description</code>: A quick description of the app's purpose. Type in something really simple, like "A
          simple npm package to learn about using npm", then press
          <code>Return</code>
          .
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>entry point</code>: This will be the top-level JavaScript file of the app. The default
          <code>index.js</code> is fine for now press
          <code>Return</code>
          .
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>test command</code>, <code>git repository</code>, and <code>keywords</code>: press
          <code>Return</code>
          to leave each of these blank for now.
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>author</code>: The author of the project. Type your own name, and press
          <code>Return</code>
          .
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>license</code>: The license to publish the package under. Press
          <code>Return</code>
          to accept the default for now.
        </li>
      </ul>
